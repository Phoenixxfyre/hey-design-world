I'm a Web Designer currently learning additional programming languages to become a Front End Web Developer. I also do some graphic design. Coding is one of my favorite things to do. I am experienced in HTML, CSS, and Adobe Creative Applications.

Things I enjoy doing include acrylic painting, horseback riding, and traveling. I also love basketball, enjoy being at the beach, and watching a good movie.
